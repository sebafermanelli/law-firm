Practice 1

- Create a simple system.out app. Print info about the user that should be passed to the mail
  function as a parameter.
  Compile and run the program
  from the command line using javac and java from JDK.
- Sorting algorithm implementation. Choose any from the list: insertion sort, selection sort, bubble
  sort, merge sort,
  quicksort.
- Extra homework: [Two-sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Practice 2

- Create a class hierarchy.
    - At least 10 classes.
    - All classes must contain properties.
    - At least 5 private properties in total.
    - All private variables must have getters and setters.
    - All classes should have at least one custom constructor.
    - Create separate class with main() which will instantiate objects of implemented classes.

Practice 3

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Use polymorphism with at least one abstract class.
    - Create and override at least one abstract method.
    - Use protected modifier at least 5 times.
    - Override methods from class Object (toString(), hashCode(), equals()) for at least 3 classes
      from the hierarchy.

Practice 4

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Add 5 interfaces in the existing hierarchy.
    - Use polymorphism with the abstract class and interface from the hierarchy.
    - Create final class, method, variable.
    - Create a static block, method, variable.

Practice 5

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Create 5 custom exceptions.
    - Handle exceptions in 2 ways.
    - Use try-catch with resources.
    - Log messages to the console, file.

Practice 6

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Add 5 collections to the hierarchy.

- Create custom LinkedList with generic.

Practice 7

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Move all projects to Maven.
    - Build jar file and deploy to the local repository.
    - Add 2 Plugins.
    - Run mvn for different phases from the Maven lifecycle. Check the result.

Practice 8

- Generate a conflict in a merge
- Make a pull request with branches
- Make a pull request with forks

Practice 9

- Read text from the file and calculate the numbers of the unique words. Write the result to the file. The main requirement is: using
  StringUtils and FileUtils to implement it with minimum lines of code.

Practice 10

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Use at least 5 lambda functions from the java.util.function package.
    - Create 3 custom Lambda functions with generics.
    - Create 5 complex Enums(with fields, methods, blocks).

Practice 11

- Extended your previous homework with next features:
    - Add 7 collection streaming in the hierarchy with terminal and non-terminal operations.
    - Using reflection extract information(modifiers, return types, parameters, etc) about fields, constructors, methods. Create object and call
      method using the only reflection.

Practice 12

- Create 2 Threads using Runnable and Thread.
- Create Connection Pool. Use collection from java.util.concurrent package. Connection class may be mocked. The pool should be threadsafe and lazy 
  initialized.
- Initialize pool with 5 sizes. Load Connection Pool using threads and Thread Pool (7 threads). 5 threads should be able to get the connection. 2 
  threads should wait for the next available connection. The program should wait as well.
- Implement 4th part but with IFuture and CompletableStage.
